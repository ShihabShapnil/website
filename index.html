                <h3>Hardware Engineering</h3>
                <p>From consoles to computers, I grew up around a lot of technology. 
                  My biggest hobby was playing video games, primarily computer games. However, moving forward, the demands for games 
                  were taxing to outdated computers. And as any aspiring 14-year-old gamer would be, I learned how to build my own computer. 
                  With that, the thirst for building and learning continued to grow.

                <h3>Technology and Software Development</h3>
                  <p>As the end of high school approached, more computers were built and more knowledge was learned. I was finally able to play the video games I wanted but 
                    this only opened another path. I wanted to learn how these video games were created. So I dove into the software aspect of technology and learned 2 languages, HTML and CSS.

                <h3>Stony Brook University</h3>
                <p>Ah, time for college. The beginning of college was an interesting time because I wasn’t 100 percent sure if I wanted to focus on the hardware or software aspect of computers. 
                  I wanted the best of both worlds, so I decided on Computer Engineering. This gave me the freedom to work with hardware and focus on software at the same time. I believe 
                  this was one of the best decisions in my college career.
